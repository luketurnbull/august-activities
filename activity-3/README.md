## Running the project

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO

- [x] Create next app with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [ ] Add shadcn/ui for quick component creation
- [ ] Look into [YouTube API)(https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

Thoughts:

- Use Zustand for state management? Easy to add local storage.
- Use react-query for fetching data? Or too overkill? Decide later.
