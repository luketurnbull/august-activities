**Location:** `activity-2` folder
This is located inside the `activity-2` folder. Please see the `README.md` file inside for the todos and feedback.

**Feedback:**
I would like to spend more time on the design and animations, I think it could look a lot nicer. There is also a issue with the main picture "header" being cut off on mobile, but it was either that or zooming in on the guys head which looked weird.

### Activity 3

**Time taken:** 8-10 hours
**Deployed to Vercel**: https://youtube-favs-amber.vercel.app/

**Location:** `activity-3` folder
This is located inside the `activity-3` folder. Please see the `README.md` file inside for the todos and feedback.

**Feedback**:
I got a little stuck with the Youtube API running out of quota, but I was able to get around it by using mock hard coded data.

I enjoyed this activity the most as I got to be creative with the design, I would like to spend more time implementing some animations, possible with Framer Motion to make it feel more alive.

## TODOs and Feedback

You can find the todos in each activity folder on how I approached them, they are at the bottom of each `README.md` file inside the activity folders. I made sure to commit the code regularly and try to explain my thought process.
